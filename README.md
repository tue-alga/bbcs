BBCS is a simulator for billiard-ball computers.

## Building

BBCS uses webpack to bundle the JavaScript code and its dependencies into a bundle.

First install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Build the tool (output appears in the `dist` folder):

```sh
npm run build
```

Run a development server that automatically rebuilds the bundle (and reloads the page in the browser) on code changes:

```sh
npm run start
```
